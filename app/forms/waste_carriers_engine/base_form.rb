    # The standard behaviour for loading a form is to check whether the requested form matches the workflow_state for
    # the registration, and redirect to the saved workflow_state if it doesn't.
    # But if the workflow state is 'flexible', we skip the check and load the requested form instead of the saved one.
    # This means users can still navigate by using the browser back button and reload forms which don't match the
    # saved workflow_state. We then update the workflow_state to match their request, rather than the other way around.
